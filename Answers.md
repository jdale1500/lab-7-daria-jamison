# COMP 271 002 F17 Lab 5 (Week 7)

# Daria / Jamison

-An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:
#Why does LinkedStack not require an explicit instructor?

- Linkedlist is implemented.

# What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the LinkedStack methods, as well as ReverseLines.main?

- Linear

# How else (not using Node) could we have implemented LinkedStack in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the asList method uses constant time and space?

- Implemented an iterator. 

# Is it better for push and pop to return the item or the stack itself? Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.

- The pop option is good if you are trying to remove the top and return the item while the push will insert an item to the top of the stack. The stack will only allow you to access the top, last-in, first-out
